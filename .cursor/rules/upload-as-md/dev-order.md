<!-- 
Ask: Please read all the rules files and tell me which of those files and in what order you need to read them in order to produce code for a given kernal for a given GPU on a given platform.  I suggest you start with [project-overview.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-overview.mdc) and [platforms.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/platforms.mdc). Be sure to skip [dev-order.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev-order.mdc) and [format-consistency-check.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/format-consistency-check.md). Make sure you output in markdown format and create a concise summary with clickable links to the .mdc files and make the result appliable to [dev-order.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev-order.mdc).

# Mojo GPU Kernel Development Guide

Below is the optimal reading order for understanding how to develop GPU kernels in Mojo for specific platforms:

1. [Project Overview](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-overview.mdc) - Understanding the project requirements and specifications
2. [Platforms](mdc:.cursor/rules/platforms.mdc) - Details on supported development and target platforms
3. [Environment Setup](mdc:.cursor/rules/environment-setup.mdc) - Setting up Modular Platform 25.3 for GPU programming
4. [Project Structure](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc) - Standard organization for Mojo GPU projects
5. [GPU Programming](mdc:.cursor/rules/gpu-programming.mdc) - Best practices for GPU optimizations, especially for AMD Radeon GPUs
6. [Testing & Benchmarking](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing-benchmarking.mdc) - Guidelines for validating and measuring performance

## Development Workflow Summary

This sequence provides a complete workflow for developing optimized GPU kernels in Mojo:

1. First, understand the project requirements and available platforms
2. Set up your development environment with Modular Platform 25.3
3. Organize your project according to the standard structure
4. Apply GPU-specific programming techniques for your target hardware
5. Implement thorough testing and performance benchmarking

Following this order ensures you'll have all the necessary knowledge to develop, optimize, and validate your GPU kernel implementation while adhering to project standards.
