### Key Features:

1. Parallel Implementation: This CUDA code launches multiple threads, each starting with a different initial guess, allowing it to find all roots simultaneously.
2. Customizable Function: The code demonstrates two approaches:
	-  A hardcoded function for simplicity
	- A more flexible approach using function pointers
3. Error Handling:
	- Checks for division by zero when the derivative is too small
	- Filters results based on function value to eliminate false roots
4.  Performance Optimizations:
	- Uses shared memory for faster access
	- Limits iteration count to prevent infinite loops
5. Configurable Parameters:
	- Tolerance for convergence criteria
	- Maximum iterations
	- Range of initial guesses
To modify this for your own function, simply change the f(x) and df(x) device functions, or pass different function pointers to the generic kernel.

For higher-dimensional problems, you would need to extend this to vector operations and Jacobian matrices, but the core Newton-Raphson algorithm remains the same.
