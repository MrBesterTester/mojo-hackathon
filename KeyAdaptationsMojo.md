# Key Adaptations for Mojo

### 1. SIMD Vectorization
- Implemented SIMD-based computation using Mojo's native `SIMD[Float32, simd_width]` type
- Allows multiple roots to be calculated simultaneously on a single core
- Uses SIMD masks for selective evaluation, improving efficiency by skipping converged values

### 2. Multi-Core Parallelization
- Leverages Mojo's `parallelize` function for distributing work across available CPU cores
- Chunk-based processing enables better cache utilization and load balancing
- Scales automatically with the number of available cores

### 3. Modern Memory Management
- Uses Mojo's `Tensor` type instead of raw arrays for better memory safety
- Simplifies memory handling without manual allocation/deallocation
- Enables seamless data transfers between CPU and GPU

### 4. Numerical Stability Enhancements
- Implemented robust error checking and validation
- Added safeguards against division by zero using threshold-based comparisons
- Uses conditional selection within SIMD operations to handle edge cases

### 5. Root Classification
- Added post-processing to identify and remove duplicate roots
- Improved result reporting with function value verification
- Provides a cleaner set of unique solutions

### 6. GPU Compatibility
- Designed with GPU execution in mind using Mojo's abstractions
- Code structure maintains compatibility with GPU compute model
- Optimized for both CPU and GPU execution without code changes

### 7. Type Safety and Performance
- Leverages Mojo's strong typing system for compile-time optimizations
- Uses parameter functions for better inlining and performance
- Maintains numerical precision while ensuring high performance
